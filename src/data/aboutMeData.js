    bio: `Tēnā Koe! I'm a full stack developer from Northland who is fueled by creating accessible software for Kiwis. My journey into tech began during my time in a small digital team at GSK (a global pharmaceutical company), where I saw the possibilities for technology to revolutionize New Zealand's healthcare system. I decided that I wanted to get in on the action by being a creator of technology rather than just a user.`,
